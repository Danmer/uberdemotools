To do:
* DLL: Use FatalError on all the real fatal errors (done for virtual memory allocation)
- A "Search" tab for finding demos matching certain criteria? (players, maps, modes, protocol, etc)
- Text format export (XML? JSON?)
- Player position smoothing for "laggy" demos
- DLL: Better mid-air detection heuristics?
- DLL: Give plug-ins the ability to tell when their job is done so that parsing can be stopped early
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "max. time after spawn" option to detect sequences of spawnfrags
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "all kills vs the same player" option?
- Auto-rename functionality (read the first game-state message and rename the demo using the info extracted)
- DLL: 73 to 90 converter: fix the pmove_flags issue
- DLL: 90 to 68 converter: convert the mean of death index in obituary events
- DLL: 90 to 68 converter: investigate/fix the stuff marked in the code
