To do:
* DLL: Use FatalError on all the real fatal errors (done for virtual memory allocation)
- Explain in help that the "Player Selection" option is respected by everything except the Chat filter
- Remove forced a) text coloring and b) highlight color of log messages for better theme integration (use prefixes for warnings and errors)
- Remove the demo viewer stuff from the repo (in develop then master by merging)
- DLL: New Huffman codec: id's code is loaded with pointers everywhere... a good replacement would be a simple Huffman codec with pre-built look-up tables and no pointers
- Improved GameStates analyzer (all players with: time range, player index, team(s))
- A "Search" tab for finding demos matching certain criteria? (players, maps, modes, protocol, etc)
- Text format export (XML? JSON?)
- Player position smoothing for "laggy" demos
- DLL: Better mid-air detection heuristics?
- DLL: Give plug-ins the ability to tell when their job is done so that parsing can be stopped early
