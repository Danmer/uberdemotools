To do:
* DLL: Use FatalError on all the real fatal errors (done for virtual memory allocation)
- Improved GameStates analyzer (all players with: time range, player index, team(s))
- A "Search" tab for finding demos matching certain criteria? (players, maps, modes, protocol, etc)
- Text format export (XML? JSON?)
- Player position smoothing for "laggy" demos
- DLL: Better mid-air detection heuristics?
- DLL: Give plug-ins the ability to tell when their job is done so that parsing can be stopped early
- DLL: Create a global library-wide list of udtVMLinearAllocator instances currently alive so that memory stats (bytes reserved/committed/used) can be accessed easily in debug mode
- DLL: Reduce memory consumption (and page fault count) by passing allocators (re-using them) to parsers and plug-ins
- Frag Sequence cut filter: add a "max. time after spawn" option to detect sequences of spawnfrags
