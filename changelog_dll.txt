0.5.0 (17.01.2015)
CHG: New memory allocation strategy
ADD: Memory allocators tracking
CHG: The most frequent parsing errors cancel the operation for the current file instead of calling the crash handler
CHG: Most parsing errors will now print the file name
FIX: Cut merging in the Cut by Pattern plug-in wasn't setting the udtCutSection::VeryShortDesc member, resulting in a crash
REM: Removed the "Processing demo for pattern analysis" message as it cluttered the log with useless data

0.4.1 (08.01.2015)
CHG: Replaced id's Huffman codec by my own to improve performance

0.4.0 (03.01.2015)

ADD: Added the "Mid-Air Frags" cut filter
ADD: Added the "Multi-Frag Rails" cut filter
ADD: Now adding a very small file name suffix specifying the type of pattern that was matched for the cut (if sections get merged, the first match's description is used)
FIX: The obituaries analyzer will now find some events that it didn't before; this change affects the frag sequence cut analyzer too
REM: Removed "Cut by Awards"

0.3.4a (22.12.2014)
CHG: Bumped up the maximum thread count in batch processing jobs to 8
FIX: Cut by Frag was ignoring the "Time Between Frags" filter!
FIX: The award analyzer will only accept the persistent counter going up as an event (as opposed to just changing)

0.3.4 (21.12.2014)
ADD: Cut by Awards (udtCutDemoFile(s)ByAward API functions)
CHG: Improved API functions argument checking
FIX: Cut by Frag was merging cut sections based on a cut "half-duration" instead of the entire duration

ADD: udtGetStringArray
FIX: udtObituariesAnalyzer now tracks player teams
CHG: udtObituariesAnalyzer: simpler way of detecting the player index of the recording player
FIX: ParseConfigStringValueInt and ParseConfigStringValueString would match variable names at invalid spots
FIX: The input server time wasn't reset, leading to invalid output cut ranges
FIX: Avoiding entity event doubling by tracking the last event time for each entity
ADD: Cut by Frag: allow self-kills/team-kills/any death options
ADD: Cut by Frag: automatic or manual player index selection
ADD: Cut by Frag: Means of Death filters

0.3.2 (11.12.2014)

0.3.1 (09.12.2014)
FIX: If the VM linear allocator's reserve size isn't a multiple of the commit granularity (which itself is a page size multiple), it's made to become one
FIX: Reserving enough address space for config string descriptors
FIX: Reserving enough address space for file descriptors in the batch process thread function
CHG: Reserving a lot more address space for server command descriptors
FIX: When the input demo is truncated, parsing doesn't fail anymore
CHG: A warning message is sent when a demo file is truncated
CHG: In batch operations, you must now supply an array of error codes
CHG: If operations on one or more demos fail in a batch process, it won't stop/invalidate everything
CHG: In udtParseDemoFiles, if some demos can't be parsed, you can still access all the data for those where it succeeded
CHG: Drop a fatal error when reserving address space from the linear allocator isn't possible (might happen easily in the x86 build)

ADD: A parser plug-in system for configurable analysis and data extraction tasks
