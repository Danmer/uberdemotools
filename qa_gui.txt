Q: 
What is it?

A: 
UDT_GUI is a Quake 3 (*.dm_68) and Quake Live (*.dm_73, *.dm_90) demo cutting and information display tool for Windows.
For instance, you can cut a large selection of demos at once by selecting a group of demos and cutting by a set of patterns (text in global chat, fast kill sequences, mid-air shots, etc), saving you the trouble of watching demos to find anything of interest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: 
What do I need to run it?

A: 
The UDT_GUI application requires .NET Framework 4.5 to be installed.
The .DLL itself and the command-line executables have no third-party dependencies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: 
What can I do with it?

A:
 - You can view some information about the selected demo ("Info" tab)
 - You can cut demos by a) manually specifying the start and end times, or b) by letting the program look for certain patterns you defined and cutting around the matches
 - You can view the global chat log, list of player deaths, etc

Q:
Can I suggest something or modify the program myself?

A:
Yes, and yes. 
 - You are encouraged to post on ESR to ask questions, report problems, request features, etc. You can also /query myT on QuakeNet.
 - The entire source code is licensed under the GPL. I was legally required to publish the source code of the DLL under the GPL, but I wasn't for the GUI. I decided it was best to do so for both.

 Q:
 Is there a repository where I can grab the most current sources?
 
 A:
 Yes, the project is hosted on Google Code.
 Here is the project page: https://code.google.com/p/uberdemotools/
